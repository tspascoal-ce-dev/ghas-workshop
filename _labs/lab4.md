# Lab 4 - Hands-on with Dependency Review

With Dependency Review enabled and configured, we want to block vulnerable packages from entering the codebase. We can define a repository ruleset to enforce this as well!

## Exercise 1: Add the Dependency Review Action

First, let's add the dependency review action workflow.

1. In the repository, click on the **Actions** tab.
2. Click on the **New workflow** button in the upper left.
3. Search for "**dependency**" and click enter on your keyboard.
4. Under the **Dependency Review** workflow, click **Configure**.

</details>

5. Review the action and its defaults on line 32-39. This action can also block specific open source license types.
6. In the upper right, click on **Commit changes...**
7. Since we have a ruleset, we have to create a branch and merge this to main via pull request. Create a branch and commit (**Propose changes**) the changes.

8. On the next screen, use the Copilot icon in the formatting bar to generate a pull request description.

</details>

9. Click **Create pull request**.
10. Wait for the code scanning job to finish. It will take a few minutes to run.
    - You will notice that the Dependency Review workflow ran against this PR and didn't report any issues.

11. Merge the PR once the code scanning completes.
12. Navigate to **Settings** of the repo.
13. Navigate to **Rules --> Rulesets**.
14. Click on the name of the ruleset you created in lab 3 to modify it.
15. Under the **Require status checks to pass**, click on the **Show additional settings** button.
16. Click on **Add checks**.
17. Search for `dependency-review` and add it (it should show up under **suggestions**).

18. Save the changes to the ruleset.

## Exercise 2: Introduce a dependency vulnerability

Now, let's attempt to add a vulnerable dependency to the codebase and test out the dependency review feature.

1. Navigate back to the **Code** tab in the repo.
2. Click the **package.json** file in the root of the repository to open it.
3. Click the **pencil** ‚úèÔ∏è icon at the top right of the file to go into edit mode.
4. Go to the end of line 181 and hit Enter to create a blank line for line 182.
5. Add the following code to line 182, making sure to include the comma at the end of the line:

```
"tar": "2.2.2",
```

6. Click the **Commit changes** button.
7. Change the branch name to **lab4/dependency-vulnerability** and click **Propose changes** to start a pull request.
8. Use the **Copilot** button in the formatting bar to generate a PR summary for you.
9. Click the **Create pull request** button.
10. Wait for the dependency review job to finish.
11. It should make a comment to the pull request with a note that it found a vulnerable package dependency. In fact, adding this one package would introduce 3 new vulnerabilities to our codebase.

12. Also, the status check will be marked as failed, preventing the pull request from being merged.

## Summary

Celebrate üéâ! We just prevented a security vulnerability from entering our codebase! Without dependency review, if a pull request from this branch was opened to main, nothing would prevent the vulnerability from being introduced.

In the next lab, we are going to go hands-on with secret scanning, and see how we can use push protection to stop secrets from being pushed to GitHub.

‚û°Ô∏è Head back to the [labs](README.md) page to continue on to the next lab.
